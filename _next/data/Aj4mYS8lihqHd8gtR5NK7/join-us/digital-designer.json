It serves as the organization’s communications hub and is made up of designers, coders, linguists, dreamers and revolutionaries. The department takes a brutalist approach to the creation process, favoring impactful designs over superfluous detail that risks diluting or warping the overall message.  \n\n### About Logos\n\nLogos emerges from and builds upon the mission undertaken by Status. More overtly political than its predecessor, Logos creates digital infrastructure to emancipate those shut out of global society by oppressive governments, economic circumstances or Big Tech overreach. The collective’s long-term goal is the formation of a network state—a purpose-driven community living within an opt-in alternative system to that of the nation state.  \n\nTo learn more about Logos, consult this [handbook](https://github.com/acid-info/public-assets/blob/master/logos-manual.pdf).\n","metadata":{"title":"Digital Designer"},"toc":[{"content":"Digital Designer","slug":"digital-designer","lvl":1,"i":0,"seen":0},{"content":"Key responsibilities","slug":"key-responsibilities","lvl":3,"i":1,"seen":0},{"content":"Ideal qualities","slug":"ideal-qualities","lvl":3,"i":2,"seen":0},{"content":"Bonus points","slug":"bonus-points","lvl":3,"i":3,"seen":0},{"content":"Compensation","slug":"compensation","lvl":3,"i":4,"seen":0},{"content":"Working with us","slug":"working-with-us","lvl":3,"i":5,"seen":0},{"content":"About Acid.info","slug":"about-acid-info","lvl":3,"i":6,"seen":0},{"content":"About Logos","slug":"about-logos","lvl":3,"i":7,"seen":0}]},"navProps":{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Digital Designer"},"navOrder":-1,"localPath":"join-us/digital-designer.md","path":["join-us","digital-designer"],"children":[],"isDir":false},"routeParams":{"path":["join-us","digital-designer"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
