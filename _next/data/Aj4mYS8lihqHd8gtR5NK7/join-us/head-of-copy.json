More overtly political than its predecessor, Logos creates digital infrastructure to emancipate those shut out of global society by oppressive governments, economic circumstances or Big Tech overreach. The collective’s long-term goal is the formation of a network state—a purpose-driven community living within an opt-in alternative system to that of the nation state.\n\nTo learn more about Logos, consult this [handbook](https://github.com/acid-info/public-assets/blob/master/logos-manual.pdf).\n\nGot what it takes?
