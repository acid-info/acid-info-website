# Digital Designer

[Acid.info](http://Acid.info) needs a visionary digital designer to join its Digital Content Studio. Our chosen candidate will be comfortable pushing the boundaries of digital content production to deliver our message across multiple mediums, applying technological solutions to ensure maximum efficiency while maintaining the highest standards. 

Logos is a grassroots movement creating technological alternatives to oppressive systems of societal control. Vehemently anti-censorship, anti-surveillance and anti-authoritarian, we support basic human rights via the creation of opt-in alternatives to traditional power structures.

Working closely with experienced activists, our ideal candidate is one who firmly aligns with Logos’ political and philosophical ethos. We’re not looking for someone that is just “into crypto/web3” but an individual that lives and breathes cypherpunk ideals and shows a passion for disruption through unconventional means.

- Stay up-to-date with current design trends, skills, and technology

### Ideal qualities

- Bachelor's degree in digital design, graphic design or a related field
- 2+ years proven experience in a professional digital design role
- A portfolio of previous digital design work to showcase experience and creativity
- Extensive knowledge and experience with various creative platforms, including Figma, Adobe products, sound and video editing software, and 3D motion software
- Solid knowledge of one or more of the following; motion (After Effects etc), 3d (Maya, C4D, Max or related), illustration (Illustrator, Painter, etc.)
- Understanding of design principles and user-centered design processes
- Ability to clearly present creative ideas and concepts for campaigns and projects
- A team player with exceptional organisational and technical skills
- Excellent communication and collaboration skills
- Commitment and willingness to learn and grow.
- A strong alignment with our [principles](https://status.im/about/#our-principles)

### Bonus points

- Web3 experience
- Code chops: Python, JavaScript, C, etc.
- Experience with Unreal Engine, Unity, etc.

### Compensation

- Expected compensation ranges from `$60,000-$80,000` for this role—negotiable for the right candidate
- Payment in any mix of fiat or crypto, with the option to choose the ratio of fiat to crypto on a monthly basis
- A stake in our success via a Status Network Token bonus package

### About Acid.info

[Acid.info](http://Acid.info) is a creative design studio within the Logos DAO. It serves as the organization’s communications hub and is made up of designers, coders, linguists, dreamers and revolutionaries. The department takes a brutalist approach to the creation process, favoring impactful designs over superfluous detail that risks diluting or warping the overall message.  

### About Logos

Logos emerges from and builds upon the mission undertaken by Status. More overtly political than its predecessor, Logos creates digital infrastructure to emancipate those shut out of global society by oppressive governments, economic circumstances or Big Tech overreach. The collective’s long-term goal is the formation of a network state—a purpose-driven community living within an opt-in alternative system to that of the nation state.
