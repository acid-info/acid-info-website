# Head of Copy

[Acid.info](http://Acid.info) is hunting for an experienced, creative Head of Copy to oversee the content production process across various mediums, including digital, print and social media. The chosen candidate will lead Logos’ copywriting and technical documentation efforts, supporting the wider organization’s communication needs.

Logos is a grassroots movement creating technological alternatives to oppressive systems of societal control. Vehemently anti-censorship, anti-surveillance and anti-authoritarian, we support basic human rights via the creation of opt-in alternatives to traditional power structures.



Working alongside experienced activists, our dream candidate is one who firmly aligns with Logos’ political and philosophical ethos. We’re not looking for someone that is just “into crypto/web3” but an individual that lives and breathes cypherpunk ideals and shows a passion for disruption through unconventional means.

### Key responsibilities:

- Design and deliver a detailed plan and roadmap for producing engaging, motivational and effective political and community-facing content that resonates with target audiences and achieves desired outcomes
- Provide effective and motivating leadership for copywriting and technical documentation team members
- Develop guidelines and best practices with the aim of improving copywriting efforts across all teams

### Ideal qualities:

- 5+ years of experience in writing and editing copy
- Experience in, and passion for, blockchain technology
- Substantial leadership experience
- Strong portfolio showcasing copywriting work
- Ability to write for different audiences and styles, adapting tone and language as needed
- Excellent communication and collaboration skills
- A strong alignment with our [principles](https://status.im/about/#our-principles)
- Strong advocacy for decentralization, free speech and privacy
- Shared values and political ideologies of the cypherpunk movement
- Comfortable working remotely and asynchronously

### Bonus points:

- Experience working with an open-source organization
- Technical writing experience
- Experience with political or activist movements

### Compensation:

- Payment in any mix of fiat or crypto, with the option to choose the ratio of fiat to crypto on a monthly basis
- A stake in our success via a Status Network Token bonus package

### Working with us:

### About Acid.info:

[Acid.info](http://Acid.info) is a creative design studio within the Logos DAO. It serves as the organization’s communications hub and is made up of designers, coders, linguists, dreamers and revolutionaries. The department takes a brutalist approach to the creation process, favoring impactful designs over superfluous detail that risks diluting or warping the overall message.

### About Logos:

Logos emerges from and builds upon the mission undertaken by Status. More overtly political than its predecessor, Logos creates digital infrastructure to emancipate those shut out of global society by oppressive governments, economic circumstances or Big Tech overreach. The collective’s long-term goal is the formation of a network state—a purpose-driven community living within an opt-in alternative system to that of the nation state.
