The chosen applicant will be tasked with developing a clear, purpose-driven communications strategy for multiple teams under the wider organization’s umbrella. We’re looking for an inspiring, motivating, impactful and energetic individual to take the reigns and reflect these qualities and our political philosophy across all future communications. 

We are building a grassroots movement to create technological alternatives to oppressive systems of societal control. Vehemently anti-censorship, anti-surveillance and anti-authoritarian, we support basic human rights via the creation of opt-in alternatives to traditional power structures.

Working alongside experienced activists, our dream candidate is one who firmly aligns with our political and philosophical ethos. We’re not looking for someone that is just “into crypto/web3” but an individual that lives and breathes cypherpunk ideals and shows a passion for disruption through unconventional means.

- Experience in community engagement, marketing and communications
- Experience successfully designing and delivering niche social media campaigns
- Ability to plan and execute event representation (both online and offline), targeting and attracting audiences from within the blockchain space
- Ability to deliver results with minimal guidance and comfortable working autonomously
- Good understanding of the political climate and developments in the privacy, data and digital rights, and blockchain space
- Ability to monitor, analyze and utilize performance data
- Excellent written and verbal communication skills
- Excellent organizational skills and the ability to initiate, monitor, prioritize and complete projects
- High degree of self-motivation and exceptional attention to detail
- Commitment and willingness to learn and grow
- A strong alignment with our [principles](https://status.im/about/#our-principles)

### Bonus points

- Bachelor's degree in marketing, business administration or a related field
- Experience with political campaigning, or with civil society or human rights organizations and NGOs
- Experience in blockchain or peer-to-peer technology
- Experience working remotely and asynchronously
- Experience working for an open-source organization or an organization aligned politically with Status
- You identify with the cypherpunk movement

### Compensation

- Expected compensation ranges from ‘$70,000-$100,000’ for this role—negotiable for the right candidate
- Payment in any mix of fiat or crypto, with the option to choose the ratio of fiat to crypto on a monthly basis
- A stake in our success via a Status Network Token bonus package

### About Acid.info

[Acid.info](http://Acid.info) is a creative design studio within Logos. It serves as the organization’s communications hub and is made up of designers, coders, linguists, dreamers and revolutionaries. The department takes a brutalist approach to the creation process, favoring impactful designs over superfluous detail that risks diluting or warping the overall message.  

### About Logos

Logos emerges from and builds upon the mission undertaken by Status. More overtly political than its predecessor, Logos creates digital infrastructure to emancipate those shut out of global society by oppressive governments, economic circumstances or Big Tech overreach. The collective’s long-term goal is the formation of a network state—a purpose-driven community living within an opt-in alternative system to that of the nation state.
