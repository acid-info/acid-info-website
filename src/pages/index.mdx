  <p>Acid is designing the future.</p>
  <p>The future is a second enlightenment of the digital world.</p>
  <p>The future is people-powered software, geared for liberation.</p>
  <p>Acid does not care who you are, anon.</p>
  <p>
    We do not care about your name, gender, race or nationality. In our world
    idea = idea and the message is the message. Our utopia is private, modular,
    decentralised, collective, meaningful.

  <p>
    Don't forget they are lying to you. The human spirit is not dead, the map is
    not the territory.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are proof of the power born from discovering together: a nomadic war
    machine in cyberspace, on a mission to create technology that supports
    freedom, justice and innovation for all.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe no one is free until we are all free, because no one is an
    island: we are all pieces of the main.

  <p>
    If we are your people, <a href="/join-us">join us.</a>
  </p>
  <p>FREE YOUR MIND :)</p>
